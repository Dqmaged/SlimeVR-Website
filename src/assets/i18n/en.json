                "question": "How Does SlimeVR Work?",
                "answer": "Each SlimeVR Tracker track its own absolute rotation using an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit). It sends the data to SlimeVR Server running on your PC via Wi-Fi connection, where SlimeVR Server combines the data from multiple trackers on your body and your body proportions to calculate position of your body using your Headset as a reference point."
            },
            "question-2": {
                "question": "Does SlimeVR Require Base Stations?",

                "question": "Can SlimeVR Be Occluded?",
                "answer": "No! SlimeVR Trackers track their own rotation, so they can't be blocked or occluded by clothes, body, blankets, walls or anything else."
            },
            "question-5": {
                "question": "What Is IMU Tracker Drift?",
                "answer": "Due to the nature of IMU trackers they are susceptible to something called yaw drift.\\nThis is not the same as controller stick drift. IMU yaw drift is caused by very minor tracking imperfections that add up overtime and cause a tracker to think it has rotated further than it actually is.\\nThis takes some time to occur and can be very easily resolved with a reset!"
            },
            "question-6": {
                "question": "How Do I Reset IMU Tracker Drift?",
                "answer": "For SlimeVR reset is very simple: just take a reset pose (by default, standing up or I-pose), and tap your chest tracker two times. You can configure other ways to reset, like key- or controller-bind or other taps."

                "question": "What's SlimeVR Tracker Extension?",
                "answer": "SlimeVR Tracker Extension is a smaller tracker that connects to a Main Tracker via a wire. It uses Main Tracker's Wi-Fi connection, battery and processing power, so it can be smaller and cheaper than a full tracker, and it also doesn't require charging."
            },
